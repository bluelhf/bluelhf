# Hi! I'm Ilari!

I'm a young software developer focusing on projects related to Java, mathematics, general software development, and Minecraft. 
I spend a lot of my time working on all kinds of [software](https://github.com/bluelhf/Nxxt), [visualisations](https://editor.p5js.org/bluelhf/sketches/MhuK4VahY), [plugins](https://github.com/bluelhf/ChatCat), and [mods!](https://github.com/bluelhf/Sprint)

## Highlights

I completed the University of Helsinki course "Elements of AI" in 2022, at the age of 16. The course included several topics,
such as neural networks, regression, the definitions of AI and machine learning, questions about the ethics of machine learning,
and even several famous logic puzzles such as the towers of Hanoi and the chicken crossing. I've also had previous experience with machine learning, neural networks specifically, in both academic contexts and in my own projects. Due to this previous experience, I completed the course in under two hours — significantly less than the five-week
period reserved for it.

This is a visualisation of the QuickSort array sorting algorithm, which uses a divide-and-conquer method to sort arrays quickly. The project allows customisable array sizes, delays, and even visualisation types, and was built in Processing 3. Sadly, though, I lost the source code for the project when cleaning my old Windows machine — this GIF is all that is left of it. I plan to make another customisable sorting visualiser in the future.

This image demonstrates AntiLagger, a Minecraft modification with the purpose of reducing lag caused by bad actors intentionally attempting to slow the server down. Minecraft servers operate by ticking, in an ideal case, 20 times every second. Unfortunately, malicious players can try to lower the ticks-per-second (TPS) value of the server to cause performance issues on the gameserver, and in some cases even the host computer. AntiLagger combats this by splitting the game world into 16x16 sections (chunks), and limiting how many entities (hostile mobs, players, etc.) and blocks can be ticked in a given chunk for every server tick.
