## About Me

I'm Ilari, a young software developer focusing on projects related to physics, maths, and Minecraft!

I spend a lot of my time working on all kinds of [software](https://github.com/bluelhf/Nxxt), [simple arcade games](https://editor.p5js.org/bluelhf/sketches/U99Wc4tm3), [visualisations](https://editor.p5js.org/bluelhf/sketches/MhuK4VahY), [plugins](https://github.com/bluelhf/ChatCat), and [mods!](https://github.com/bluelhf/Sprint)

## Highlights

This GIF is a demonstration of packet invisibility using a [Wellspring](https://github.com/Moderocky/Wellspring) server.  
Wellspring is special in that it provides an API to send Minecraft game packets to players for plugin developers. The packet invisibility plugin uses that to hide the armour of the player when the invisibility effect is applied, which is non-standard for invisibility.

  Minecraft servers operate by ticking, in an ideal case, 20 times every second. Unfortunately, malicious players can try to lower the ticks-per-second (TPS) value of the server to cause performance issues on the gameserver, and in some cases even the host computer.<br/><br/>  
  AntiLagger attempts to combat this by splitting the game world into 16x16 sections (chunks), and limiting how many entities (hostile mobs, players, etc.) and blocks can be ticked in a given chunk for every server tick.

This is a fun one. It's a visualisation of the QuickSort array sorting algorithm, which uses a divide-and-conquer method to sort arrays quickly.<br/><br/>  
This was initially made in JavaScript, but ported to Processing afterwards. The project allows customisable array sizes, delays, and even visualisation types.

  This one is an early-development screenshot of my Skyblock project, in which players on the server begin on a small, desolate floating island with no land in sight. The goal is to use quirks in the game and your own creativity to advance, expand, and create an island of your own.
