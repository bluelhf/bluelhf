# Hi! I'm Ilari!

I'm a young software developer doing whatever happens to pique my curiosity on any given day. I value correctness and performance, sometimes to a fault: it's quite easy for me to get side-tracked and spend several hours honing a single small detail.

## Cybersecurity endeavours

Along with software development, I've also taken up ethical hacking. I've actually competed in two national hacking competitions, placing fourth and first respectively, and one international one, where my team and I placed 11th. We were very happy with this placement, having been one of the smallest and least-experienced teams in the competition.
  
The image on the right is of the Cyber Battle of Nordic Baltics 2022, in which I participated in the team "chad protonmail :D", or as other teams took to calling us, just "chad".

|<p align="justify">I completed the University of Helsinki course "Elements of AI" in 2022 at the age of 16. The course included several topics,  such as neural networks, regression, the definitions of AI and machine learning, questions regarding the ethics of machine learning, and even several famous logic puzzles such as the towers of Hanoi and the chicken crossing. Previous experience enabled me to complete the course in under two hours.</p>|<p align="justify">The 2022 Cyber Security Base — Capture the Flag course was a multi-day hacking challenge where participants attempted to exploit vulnerabilities in specially-made services, applications and ciphertexts to obtain 'flags'. Scores were given based on the difficulty of and the completion time ranking for each subchallenge. I finished in fourth place, having completed 21 out of 23 challenges and ranking in the top two in seven.</p>|

This is a visualisation of the QuickSort array sorting algorithm, which uses a divide-and-conquer method to sort arrays quickly. The project allows customisable array sizes, delays, and even visualisation types, and was built in Processing 3. Sadly, though, I lost the source code for the project when cleaning my old Windows machine — this GIF is all that is left of it. I plan to make another customisable sorting visualiser in the future.

  This is an <a href="https://github.com/bluelhf/audio-whiz">audio visualiser</a> I wrote in Rust. It usilises Nannou for graphics, and an FFT library for obtaining the frequency spectrum for audio from a .WAV file. All signal processing, such as windowing, padding, and other operations are done manually using home-made DSP. The video shows an early demo of the visualiser output for Nightwish' live cover of Phantom of the Opera, sung by Tarja Turunen.

This image demonstrates AntiLagger, a Minecraft modification with the purpose of reducing lag caused by bad actors intentionally attempting to slow the server down. Minecraft servers operate by ticking, in an ideal case, 20 times every second. Unfortunately, malicious players can try to lower the ticks-per-second (TPS) value of the server to cause performance issues on the gameserver, and in some cases even the host computer. AntiLagger combats this by splitting the game world into 16x16 sections (chunks), and limiting how many entities (hostile mobs, players, etc.) and blocks can be ticked in a given chunk for every server tick.
